## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing lung disease data to understand how many people are affected by different lung-related health conditions. The analysis is performed using Python data analytics libraries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Objective

To analyze lung disease data using Python
To identify the number of people suffering from different lung diseases
To visualize disease distribution for better understanding

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of individuals along with information related to lung diseases. It includes categorical data that helps in identifying disease patterns and frequency.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

**Jupyter Notebook**

Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values
Verified data consistency
Prepared data for analysis using Pandas

## Data Analysis
Grouped data to calculate disease-wise patient counts
Used groupby(), value_counts(), and unstack() for aggregation
Converted results into a structured format for visualization

## Data Visualization

Bar charts were created to compare the number of people suffering from different lung diseases
Visualizations helped in identifying the most common diseases in the dataset

## Key Insights

The dataset shows variation in patient counts across different lung diseases
Certain lung diseases are more prevalent compared to others
Visualization makes comparison and interpretation easier

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python and Pandas for real-world healthcare data analysis. By cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, meaningful insights were extracted regarding lung disease distribution. The project highlights how data analytics can support better understanding and decision-making in the healthcare domain.
